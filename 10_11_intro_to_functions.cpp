// most basic function is main function. 
// it is called once the program is executed.
// int main() to be specific

// let's say we have a func called pow ( 10 , 2 );
// pow ( 10, 2 ) while 10 and 2 are called 
// arguments
// args are the input -> pow is the machine -> output is return

//benefit of functions is it makes the code more managable.

// code below is how we generate a function
int multiply(int x, int y)
{
	return x*y;
}

int z = multiply(2,5);

// we always need to declare the function
// before we can use it anywhere inside the code.
// we can aswell declare the function inside a header file.
